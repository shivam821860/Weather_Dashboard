# Weather_Dashboard
🌤️ Project Title: Real-Time Weather & AQI Dashboard.

📌 Short Description:
An interactive dashboard that displays real-time weather and air quality data for selected cities using data from WeatherAPI.com. It provides clean visualizations and actionable insights for both general users and environmental analysts.

🎯 Purpose:
The goal of this project is to:
Showcase real-time weather conditions and AQI (Air Quality Index) using reliable APIs.
Practice end-to-end data transformation and dashboard development.
Help users monitor environmental conditions to make informed decisions.

🛠️ Tech Stack:
Power BI – For data transformation, modeling, and dashboard creation.
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – For building dynamic, reusable AQI measures.
Power Query – For data cleaning and preprocessing.

🌐 Data Source:
WeatherAPI.com – Provides real-time weather and air quality data via RESTful API.

✨ Features / Highlights:
📡 Real-time Weather Metrics: Temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.
🌫️ Air Quality Index (AQI): Reusable AQI measures implemented in DAX.
🏙️ City-Based Data Filter: Select and visualize data for multiple cities.
📊 User-Friendly Interface: Clear visuals for quick interpretation.
🔁 Auto-refresh Support: Keeps data up-to-date.

🧠 What I Learned:
How to connect APIs to Power BI using Power Query.
Building and using reusable DAX measures for real-time metrics.
Data transformation best practices in Power BI.

✅ Conclusion:
This Weather & AQI Dashboard project demonstrates my ability to work with real-time data, transform it effectively, and present it in a visually compelling and informative way using Power BI. From API integration to reusable DAX measures, the project reflects my growing skills in data analysis and dashboard development.
